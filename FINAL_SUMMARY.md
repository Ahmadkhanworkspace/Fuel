## 🎯 Current Status

**Dashboard**: ✅ Fully functional  
**Mobile App**: ✅ Code complete  
**Mobile Web**: ⚠️ Needs asset files  

The mobile app code is complete but showing JSON manifest due to missing favicon/icon. The dashboard is working perfectly!

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Use the Dashboard** - it's fully functional and has all features including employee photos, OCR, GPS, and maps!

The mobile app can be finalized later by adding the missing image files.
