# Smart Vehicle & Fuel Management System (SVFMS)

**Target stack:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) + Vercel (Next.js dashboard + serverless OCR/AI) + React Native (Android) / Flutter for mobile.

**Purpose:** Provide a full, developer-ready project plan for implementing a Vehicle & Fuel Management System for sugar mills that prevents fuel fraud, supports employee accounts, tracks maintenance, calculates vehicle averages, and provides a management dashboard with analytics and BI.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Build a secure, auditable SVFMS that allows employees to submit fuel claims with photo, timestamp, GPS, and meter reading; automatically extracts data via OCR; runs anti-fraud checks (geofencing, image hashing, nonce overlay); and provides a web dashboard for approvals, analytics, and maintenance tracking. Use Supabase for DB/Auth/Storage and Vercel for dashboard and serverless functions. Mobile app (Android) built in React Native for claims and maintenance logging.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

1. Provide reliable way for employees to claim allotted fuel (e.g., 100 L) with tamper-resistant evidence.
2. Detect and prevent fake bills and replayed images.
3. Offer vehicle maintenance lifecycle: requests, approvals, cost tracking.
4. Provide driver/vehicle analytics: average mileage, fuel consumption, maintenance cost per km.
5. Integrate with existing ERP/finance system (via REST webhook or export).
6. Deploy quickly using serverless infrastructure (Supabase + Vercel).

---

## 3. Scope & Deliverables

### MVP (must-haves)

* Android app: login, claim fuel flow (camera capture, GPS, odometer, upload), offline queue.
* Backend: Supabase DB & storage, claim ingestion endpoint, OCR integration (Vercel), basic fraud rules (zone, duplicate images), RLS policies.
* Web dashboard: claim queue, approve/reject, map view, vehicle list, maintenance form.
* Authentication: Supabase Auth (employee + admin roles).
* Minimal analytics: consumption per vehicle and pending approvals.

### Phase 2

* Nonce overlay, pump QR/NFC support, robust OCR parsing, odometer reconciliation.
* Maintenance module (request → approve → expense tracking).
* Zone management with polygon support.
* Notifications via FCM & Supabase realtime.

### Phase 3

* Machine learning anomaly detection & driver risk scoring.
* ERP integration endpoints & scheduled reconciliations.
* Predictive maintenance alerts.

---

## 4. Key Features (detailed)

* Vehicle selection (auto if assigned)
* Fuel claim flow:

  * Force camera capture (no gallery), capture 2–3 photos (receipt, odometer, pump)
  * Auto-capture GPS & device timestamp
  * OCR preview showing parsed liters, price, odometer; user can correct
  * Add manual odometer reading if OCR fails
  * One-time nonce overlay support and pump QR scan
  * Offline queue with automatic retry
* Maintenance request flow: capture invoice/photo, odometer, workshop details
* My history: claims, maintenance logs, averages & alerts

### Admin Dashboard (Next.js)

* Claim detail: images, OCR result, EXIF, GPS map location, fraud flags
* Approve / Reject (single or bulk) with reason templates
* Vehicles list: assigned drivers, last odometer, avg mileage, upcoming service
* Maintenance queue & vendor management
* Zones management: create/edit polygon or circle, assign allowed vehicles
* Analytics: charts for fuel consumption, high consumers, zone violations
* Exports: CSV, PDF reports

### Anti-Fraud Controls

* EXIF & metadata checks (timestamp consistency)
* Signed upload tokens & server nonce overlay process
* Perceptual image hashing to detect reused pictures
* Zone/geofence validation
* Duplicate claim signature detection
* Device integrity checks (rooted device warnings)

---

## 5. High-Level Architecture

* **Mobile App (React Native)** connects with Supabase client SDK for Auth/Storage/Realtime.
* **Supabase** (Postgres + Storage + Auth)

  * Tables: employees, vehicles, claims, maintenance_logs, odometer_logs, zones, notifications
  * RLS policies to enforce data access
* **Vercel (Next.js API routes or Edge Functions)**

  * OCR & image preprocessing (call external OCR like Google Vision)
  * Fraud scoring service & webhook handlers
* **BI/Analytics**: Supabase SQL views + Metabase or embedded analytics
* **Notifications**: Supabase Realtime + FCM for push messages

(Sketch diagram: Mobile ↔ Supabase (Auth/DB/Storage) ↔ Vercel OCR/AI ↔ Dashboard & BI)

## 7. API Endpoints (examples)

> Use Supabase Edge Functions or Next.js API routes. All endpoints should require Auth (JWT) and perform role checks.

* `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — handled by Supabase Auth
* `GET /api/v1/vehicles` — list vehicles (RLS enforced)
* `POST /api/v1/claims` — upload claim metadata + photos
* `GET /api/v1/claims?status=pending` — admin queue
* `GET /api/v1/claims/{id}` — claim details
* `POST /api/v1/claims/{id}/approve` — approve claim
* `POST /api/v1/claims/{id}/reject` — reject with reason
* `POST /api/v1/ocr` — trigger OCR processing for uploaded image (or Vercel will call this)
* `GET /api/v1/analytics/vehicle/{id}` — vehicle performance
* `POST /api/v1/maintenance` — submit maintenance request
* `GET /api/v1/zones` — list/manage zones

---

## 8. Authentication & Security

### Supabase Auth

* Use email + password or SSO via corporate identity provider
* Add custom JWT claims for `role` and `employee_id`

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Examples

```sql
-- Employees can select their own claims
CREATE POLICY "Employees can view own claims" ON claims
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = employee_id::text);

-- Employees can insert their own claims
CREATE POLICY "Employees can insert claim" ON claims
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = employee_id::text);
```

### File Security

* All images stored private in Supabase Storage. Generate signed URLs for viewing in dashboard.
* All uploads must use signed upload tokens to avoid direct unauthenticated writes.

### General

* TLS enforced; secure env vars in Vercel; rotate keys periodically.
* Audit logs for approvals/rejections and major actions.

---

## 9. OCR & Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Upload**: Mobile uploads photos to Supabase Storage with signed upload URL.
2. **Trigger**: Storage `INSERT` webhook or Edge function triggers OCR job.
3. **Preprocess** (Vercel): deskew, crop, denoise, increase contrast.
4. **OCR Engine**: Google Vision / Azure Form Recognizer / AWS Textract. Use Tesseract as fallback.
5. **Parse**: Use heuristics & regex to extract liters, price, date, odometer.
6. **Confidence**: Save OCR confidence. If below threshold, mark for manual review.
7. **Fraud Checks**:

   * Compare EXIF timestamp to claim timestamp
   * pHash duplicate detection
   * GPS zone check
   * nonces & QR/pump validation
8. **Writeback**: Update `claims` row with OCR output, fraud score, and status.

---

## 10. Anti-Fraud Mechanisms (Detailed)

* **One-time Nonce Overlay**: Server generates a short nonce on claim start; app displays it on screen; user takes photo including nonce (or prints and places it). Server verifies nonce present in OCR or image text region.
* **Pump QR / NFC**: Optionally, pumps are given QR stickers. Scanning ties claim to specific pump id.
* **Signed Upload Tokens**: Prevents reuse of public URLs.
* **Image Perceptual Hash (pHash)**: When image upload occurs, compute pHash and store. New uploads compared for near-duplicates.
* **EXIF Validation**: Check camera timestamp vs server timestamp; if inconsistent, flag.
* **Geofence**: Reject or flag claims outside allowed zones.
* **Device Integrity**: App checks for rooted devices and GPS spoofing tools; flag or prevent claim.
* **Odometer Reconciliation**: Using last odometer, compute expected liters; if mismatch > threshold — flag.
* **Anomaly Scoring**: Combine all signals into `fraud_score` (0–100); use thresholds for auto-approval vs manual review.

## 11. Mobile App: UI / Screen Specs

### Screens

* Splash / Login (Supabase Auth)
* Home / Dashboard (quota, vehicle, quick actions)
* Claim Fuel (stepper): select vehicle → capture photos → confirm OCR → submit
* Maintenance Request: form + photos
* My History: list of claims & statuses
* Vehicle Details: odometer, avg mileage, next_service
* Settings: notifications, profile

### Camera UX

* Force camera mode, overlay grid, live GPS & timestamp display.

---

## 13. Integration Points

* **ERP/Finance:** Export approved claims to ERP via REST webhook or scheduled CSV export. Provide webhooks and SFTP or API endpoints.
* **Map provider:** Mapbox / Google Maps for visualizations and geofencing computations.
* **OCR provider:** Google Vision or Azure as primary; Tesseract as fallback.
* **Push notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android.

---

## 14. Testing & QA Plan

**Unit Tests**

* RLS policies: employee can only access own claims

**E2E Tests**

* Mobile claim submission to approval cycle using test accounts.

**Manual QA Checklist**

* Camera capture forced and nonce verified
* GPS accuracy & geofence checks
* OCR accuracy across sample receipts
* Duplicate image rejection
* Offline submission & retry

**Security Testing**

* Penetration test for API endpoints

## 16. Monitoring & Logging

* Use Supabase logs for DB and Edge Function logs.
* Integrate Sentry for backend/edge function monitoring.
* Monitor OCR error rate, fraud flags, failed uploads.
* Set up alerts for high fraud_score volume or storage anomalies.

---

## 17. Data Retention & Compliance

* Retain claims & images for X years (configurable). Archive old images to cold storage (e.g., S3 Glacier) after 1 year.
* Ensure personal data (employee PII) handled per local laws.
* Provide deletion endpoint for GDPR/Right-to-be-forgotten if necessary.

---

## 18. Acceptance Criteria (sample)

* Employee can submit a claim with photos, GPS, and odometer; data appears in dashboard.
* OCR extracts liters & odometer with ≥ 80% accuracy for tested receipts.
* Fraud scoring flags >90% of purposely manipulated test receipts.
* RLS prevents one employee from seeing another's claims.
* Admin can approve/reject and export approved claims for ERP reconciliation.

---

## 19. Milestones & Suggested Timeline (phased)

**Milestone A — MVP (4–6 weeks recommended)**

* Supabase project & schema

## 24. Next Actions for You (to hand to developer)

1. Share this document and give developer access to Supabase + Vercel.
2. Provide sample receipts (photos) for OCR tuning.
3. Decide the required retention policy & legal constraints.
4. Choose OCR provider (Google Vision recommended) and provide API key.
5. Prioritize MVP features for first sprint.

---

## 25. Final Notes

This plan is intended to be a complete, developer-facing blueprint. The DB schema, API endpoints, and UI screens are deliberately detailed to avoid ambiguity during implementation. Developers should break the plan into sprints, write unit/integration tests, and run pilot deployments in a limited set of mills before full rollout.

## 26. Improvements & Recommendations

### Critical Improvements for Production

#### OCR Accuracy & Fallback Strategy
- **Challenge**: 80% OCR accuracy may be optimistic for diverse receipt formats
- **Solution**: Implement multi-engine fallback (Google Vision → Azure → Tesseract)
- **Action**: Add confidence thresholds (<70% = manual review required)
- **Testing**: Validate on 100+ real Indian fuel receipts before production

#### Mobile Offline Functionality
- **Enhancement**: Detailed offline queue implementation
  - Queue limit: max 100 offline claims per device
  - Compression: Compress images before queuing (max 2MB per photo)
  - Priority: GPS + Timestamp determine submission order
  - Retry: Exponential backoff (1s → 5s → 15s) with max 5 attempts
  - Conflict resolution: Last-write-wins with server timestamp authority
  - Batching: Upload max 3 claims per sync batch to prevent timeout

#### Performance Optimization
- **Database**: Add composite indexes for common queries:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_claims_status_created ON claims(status, created_at DESC);
  CREATE INDEX idx_fraud_score ON claims(fraud_score) WHERE fraud_score > 50;
  CREATE INDEX idx_vehicle_odometer ON vehicles(assigned_employee_id, last_odometer);
  ```
- **Caching**: Use Redis/Upstash for frequently accessed data:
  - Vehicle list (TTL: 5 min)
  - Pending claims count (TTL: 1 min)
  - OCR results (TTL: 24 hours)
- **Async Processing**: Move pHash computation to background jobs (Supabase Edge Functions with queues)

#### Network Resilience
- **Adaptive Upload**: Chunk large images (split > 5MB into parts)
- **Resume Capability**: Track upload progress, resume on reconnection
- **Connection Timeout**: 30s per request, 2 min total for multi-photo upload
- **Compression**: Use WebP for receipts (60% size reduction) but keep JPEG for odometer photos

#### Admin Dashboard Enhancements
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select with Ctrl+Click, batch approve/reject up to 50 at once
- **Advanced Filters**: Save filter presets ("High Risk This Week", "Pending > 5 Days")
- **Quick Actions**: Keyboard shortcuts (A = approve, R = reject, Tab = next claim)
- **Reason Templates**: Dropdown with pre-filled rejection reasons
- **Time Savers**: 
  - "Approve similar" checkbox (auto-approve claims from same zone with low fraud score)
  - "Auto-approve trusted drivers" setting per vehicle
  - Excel export with all OCR data for manual reconciliation

#### Mobile Permissions & UX
- **Permissions**: Clear onboarding explaining why location/camera needed
- **Graceful Degradation**: If location denied, allow "Enter manually" with warning
- **Foreground Service**: Show persistent notification during upload to prevent OS kill
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduce background sync frequency to every 10 minutes
- **Storage Management**: Auto-delete successfully uploaded photos after 7 days

#### Network Conditions
- **Sugar Mill Context**: Expect 3G connectivity, intermittent failures
- **Smart Sync**: Only sync when on WiFi or when battery > 20%
- **Photo Quality**: Use adaptive compression (low network = higher compression)
- **Message Queue**: Supabase Realtime for status updates (fallback to polling if WebSocket fails)

### Architecture Enhancements

#### Multi-Tenancy (if serving multiple mills)
- Add `organization_id` to all tables
- Enforce RLS: `USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'org_id' = organization_id::text)`
- Separate storage buckets per org
- Per-org config: fraud thresholds, zone rules, quotas

#### Cost Optimization
- **OCR**: Cache OCR results for 30 days (duplicate receipts)
- **Storage**: Tiering strategy: Hot (1 month) → Warm (Supabase Archive) → Cold (S3 Glacier after 1 year)
- **API**: Rate limit mobile app: max 50 uploads per hour per device
- **Database**: Set up connection pooling (PgBouncer)

#### Monitoring Enhancements
- **Fraud Dashboard**: Track fraud patterns by zone, vehicle, employee
- **Health Checks**: Monitor OCR success rate (alert if < 60% for 1 hour)
- **Cost Tracking**: Supabase storage usage per org, OCR API costs
- **User Analytics**: Track claim submission times (detect suspicious patterns)

### Open Questions to Clarify
1. **Volume**: How many claims per day? (affects auto-scaling strategy)
2. **Multi-tenant?**: One app per mill or shared instance?
3. **ERP Priority**: Phase 1 integration or can wait for Phase 3?
4. **Budget**: Budget allocated for Google Vision API (estimate: $0.0015 per image)?
