# 🔐 Create Admin User in Supabase

## The login isn't working because the user doesn't exist yet!

### ✅ Quick Fix - Create User Now:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tksodydfsuierqlnmnrr
   ```

2. **Click "Authentication"** in the left sidebar

3. **Click "Users"** tab

4. **Click "+ Add User"** button

5. **Fill in:**
   - **Email**: `admin@svfms.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123` (or whatever you want)
   - Leave "Send invitation email" unchecked for now

6. **Click "Create User"**

7. **Go back to** http://localhost:3000/login
   - Enter the email and password
   - Click "Sign in"
   - You should be in! ✅

## 🎯 Alternative: Demo Mode Without Auth

If you want to skip authentication for now and just see the dashboard, I can add a bypass mode.

Just let me know!
