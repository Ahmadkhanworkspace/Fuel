# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read This First!

## ✅ Your server is configured but needs to be started properly

### 🚀 The Easiest Way to Start:

**Double-click `start-server.bat` in your project folder**

This will:
1. Refresh PATH to find Node.js
2. Install dependencies (if needed)
3. Start the development server
4. Show you the URL to open

---

## 📋 If that doesn't work:

### Open PowerShell and run manually:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "d:\ASML Vehicle Management system"

# Refresh PATH
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")

# Verify Node.js
node --version
npm --version

# Start server
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Once Server Shows "Ready"
